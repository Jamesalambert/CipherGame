You look up and see a shape morphing from an oval to a circle to a barely discernible disc. It spins towards you until it is a blur of liquid metal then suddenly stops mid-air. A beam of light opens up in its centre, dazzling you with its brightness and a great roar of air blasts the dust into the skies.",

You are frozen to the spot with fear. ‘Don’t worry,’ the creature says, ‘I’m here in your mind. I can see and feel everything you feel. I am Hurth, Queen of the Zlogs. Let me introduce you to my subjects. You don’t want to miss the welcome party.’ The alien Queen points to the beam of light under the spaceship.",
