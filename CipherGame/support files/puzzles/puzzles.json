The robot went missing inside the Sinlap crater. As you know our mission was to find signs of life on Titan but sadly we have no hope of finishing this if you canoot find the robot. The robot sends a radio message every thirty minutes the message is one two seven six. You will need to be quite close to the robot in order to detect the radio message, this is because the crater is quite deep and signals cannot escape. After you find the robot you will find all the data we need in its memory at address 1A9D. Good luck.",
